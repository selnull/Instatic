/**
 * Explicit-delete row apply — the shared write path behind the transactional
 * site-document save (PUT /admin/api/cms/site-document).
 *
 * Unlike the retired roster reconcile (reap-by-omission: rows missing from a
 * shipped roster were soft-deleted, which required optimistic-concurrency
 * baselines to avoid eating sibling sessions' rows), deletion here is
 * EXPLICIT: the caller names the row ids to soft-delete. Rows the caller
 * doesn't mention are untouched — a stale client cannot delete anything by
 * omission.
 *
 * Ordering inside the transaction is load-bearing because of the partial
 * unique index `data_rows_table_slug_active_idx (table_id, slug) where
 * deleted_at is null and slug <> ''`, which is enforced per statement:
 *
 *   1. Delete FIRST. A written row may take the slug of a row this same
 *      request deletes (homepage swap + delete of the old homepage saved in
 *      one batch); the soft-delete frees the slug before any write needs it.
 *   2. Two-phase slug writes. Two written rows may SWAP slugs (A↔B) — no
 *      in-place update order can avoid a transient collision, so rows whose
 *      slug changes are parked on the placeholder slug '' (exempt from the
 *      unique index) together with their cells, then all final slugs land in
 *      a second pass once every old slug is free.
 *
 * Creates run after the deletes and placeholder parks, at which point no
 * active row holds any of the batch's final slugs (validation rejected
 * collisions with kept rows before the transaction started).
 *
 * A write whose id matches a SOFT-DELETED row revives that row instead of
 * inserting (the dead row still owns the primary key): undo of a delete
 * re-submits the row with its original id on the next save.
 *
 * Every written AND soft-deleted row is stamped with the save's site-global
 * `seq` (see repositories/syncSequence.ts) so delta queries surface both
 * kinds of change to reconnecting editors.
 *
 * `applyDataRowChangesInTx` assumes an OPEN transaction — the site-document
 * handler runs shell + components + layouts + pages through one transaction,
 * and nesting `db.transaction` wedges the SQLite adapter's serialized chain
 * (the 2026-06-12 audit's critical finding; do not reintroduce).
 * `applyDataRowChanges` is the standalone wrapper that opens one.
