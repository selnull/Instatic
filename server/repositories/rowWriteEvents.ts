/**
 * Row-write notification seam — repositories announce writes; interested
 * layers subscribe. Exists so the collab relay (server/collab) can reset
 * CRDT documents when a row is written OUTSIDE the relay (plugin pack
 * installs, HTTP site saves, data-workspace edits) WITHOUT repositories
 * importing upward into server/collab.
 *
 * Every event names the branch it happened on: collab documents are
 * per-branch, so a write on one branch must never reset another's docs.
 *
 * The relay's own persistence passes `collabInternal: true` through the
 * repository write functions, which then skip the notification — otherwise
 * every relay persist would reset the very documents it just persisted.

 * before reset gets a chance to reseed. Callers hold this through their
 * commit and synchronous notification; relay writes re-check invalidation
 * after they enter the same lane.
 *
 * This lane is deliberately NON-REENTRANT. A coordinated transaction must
 * call nested repositories with `collabInternal: true`, may synchronously
 * notify before returning, and must never await reset/publish-flush work from
