/**
 * Store isolation for the test suite.
 *
 * Every app store is a module-level Zustand singleton, so one instance is shared
 * by every test file in the run. `setState(partial)` MERGES, which means a file
 * that seeds a store with a hand-written partial silently inherits every field
 * it did not mention from whichever file happened to run before it. `bun test`
 * walks test files in filesystem order, and that order differs between APFS and
 * ext4, so the inherited value differs between a local run and CI.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical. A leaked `canvasView: 'live'` made
 * `canvasFormControls.test.tsx` fail on nearly every CI run for weeks while
 * passing on every local run: in live view `CanvasRoot` renders a single preview
 * frame where native form-control suppression is deliberately off, so the test
 * asserted design-mode behaviour against a preview frame.
 *
 * `resetAppStores()` runs from a global `beforeEach` in the test preload
 * (`src/__tests__/setup.ts`), so every test starts from the state the app boots
 * with and a test file only has to name what it actually wants. Add any new
 * global store to `RESETTERS` below.
