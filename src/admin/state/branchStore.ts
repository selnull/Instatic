/**
 * Active branch — which site branch this tab is editing, plus the branch
 * registry and the switcher's UI state.
 *
 * Every admin request carries the branch as the `X-Instatic-Branch` header
 * (registered as an ambient header provider at boot), every collab doc id
 * minted by the editor carries it, and the branch-scoped workspaces (Site,
 * Content, Data) remount when it changes so their data reloads.
 *
 * The active id itself is owned by `activeBranch.ts` (installed at boot so
 * the very first request carries the header); this store mirrors it for
 * React and adds the registry and UI state on top.
 *
 * Publishing and scheduling only exist on main. `useBranchPublishGate` is
 * the one place every publish control asks "am I on a branch, and what do
 * I tell the user" — the controls disable with that reason inline instead
 * of letting a click reach the server's 409.
